# 🫁 Lung Cancer Survey-Based Prediction using Machine Learning Models

An end-to-end machine learning project aimed at predicting lung cancer risk based on survey and demographic data. This project leverages various ML algorithms for early detection and risk stratification, focusing on non-invasive, cost-effective, and scalable predictive solutions.

## 🚀 Project Overview
- Developed supervised ML models to predict lung cancer risk based on lifestyle factors (smoking, alcohol intake), medical history, and self-reported symptoms.
- Utilized algorithms like **Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, SVM, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)**.
- Addressed **class imbalance challenges** using oversampling and Stratified K-Fold Cross Validation.
- Evaluated model performance using **Accuracy, Recall, Precision, F1-Score, and AUC metrics**.
- Proposed deployment frameworks via **SaaS platforms**, **Cloud-based APIs**, and **AI-powered Decision Support Systems** for radiologists and healthcare providers.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Tools
- **Python**, **Scikit-learn**, **TensorFlow/Keras**
- **Pandas**, **NumPy**, **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**
- **Flask/FastAPI (for deployment)**
- **Excel/CSV datasets**

## 🗃️ Dataset Features
- Demographics: Age, Gender, Ethnicity
- Medical History: Past lung diseases, surgeries, family history
- Lifestyle Factors: Smoking intensity, alcohol consumption
- Symptoms: Chronic cough, weight loss, yellow stool, chest pain, etc.
